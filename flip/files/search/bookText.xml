       The personal project is a signiﬁcant component of


       your educational journey, providing an opportunity

       for you to explore a topic of interest deeply and


       creatively. This project allows you to demonstrate


       your skills, knowledge, and personal growth while

       engaging in independent learning.


       In this booklet, we will focus on three key criteria


       that guide the personal project process:

             ● Criterion A: Planning


             ● Criterion B: Applying Skills


             ● Criterion C: Reflecting

       Each criterion will help you navigate the project from


       conception to completion, ensuring that you are


       well-prepared for submission.

       Planning is the foundation of a successful personal


       project. This section will guide you through the

       essential steps to effectively plan your project.


       A/ Selecting a Topic


       Choosing the right topic is the ﬁrst and most crucial


       step in your planning process. A good project topic is

       one that not only interests you but also aligns with


       your skills and the requirements of the project. Here


       are some tips for selecting your topic:

             ● Passion and Interest: Choose a subject that


                 excites you. Consider your hobbies, interests,

                 and questions you want to explore.


             ● Relevance: Ensure that your topic has


                 relevance to the community, your personal


                 experiences, or current global issues.

                 realistically completed within the timeframe


                 and resources available.

       B/ Conducting Research


       Once you have selected your topic, the next step is


       to conduct thorough research. This research will

       inform your project and provide a solid foundation


       for your work.


             ● Identifying Reliable Sources: Look for books,

                 academic articles, documentaries, interviews,


                 and credible websites. Take notes on key


                 points, quotes, and data that are relevant to

                 your topic.


             ● Note-Taking Strategies: Use methods such as


                 mind mapping, bullet points, or digital tools to

                 to synthesize information later.


       C/ Creating a Project Plan

       After gathering your research, it’s time to create a


       detailed project plan. This plan will serve as a


       roadmap for your project, outlining your goals and

       the steps needed to achieve them.


             ● Setting Clear, Achievable Goals: Break down


                 your project into smaller, manageable goals.

                 For example, if your project involves creating a


                 product, set goals for research, design,


                 production, and evaluation.

             ● Developing a Timeline: Create a timeline that


                 outlines when each phase of your project will


                 be completed. Be realistic about how much

                 time each task will take.

                 where you log your activities, thoughts,

             ● Importance of Reflection: Regularly reflect


                 on what you are learning and how you are
