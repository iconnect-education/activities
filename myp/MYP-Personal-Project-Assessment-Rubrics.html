            <h3>Criterion A, Strand i: State a learning goal for the project and explain how a personal interest led to that goal.</h3>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This strand assesses the student's ability to clearly articulate what they intend to learn or achieve through their personal project. Crucially, they must also demonstrate a genuine and explicit connection between this learning goal and their own personal interests, passions, or curiosity. It's about showing that the project is personally meaningful and driven by intrinsic motivation.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is fundamental to the personal project as it ensures the project is authentic and engaging for the student. A strong personal interest fosters deeper inquiry, sustained effort, and a more profound learning experience. It moves the project beyond a mere academic exercise to a genuine exploration of something the student cares about, leading to more meaningful outcomes and reflections.</p>

            <h3>Criterion A, Strand ii: State an intended product and develop appropriate success criteria for the product.</h3>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This strand requires the student to define a tangible or intangible outcome (the "product") that will result from their project. Furthermore, they must establish clear, measurable, and relevant criteria against which the success of this product will be judged. These criteria should directly relate to the nature and purpose of the product.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification:</strong> Defining a product provides a clear focus and end-point for the project. Developing success criteria is vital for effective planning and, later, for objective evaluation. It helps the student understand what a successful outcome looks like before they even begin, guiding their decisions and actions throughout the project. Without clear criteria, judging the success of the product becomes subjective and difficult.</p>

            <h3>Criterion A, Strand iii: Present a clear, detailed plan for achieving the product and its associated success criteria.</h3>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This strand evaluates the student's ability to create a logical, step-by-step roadmap for how they will execute their project. The plan should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate a clear understanding of the process, including the steps involved in creating the product and how those steps will lead to meeting the previously defined success criteria.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification:</strong> A well-structured plan is essential for any successful project. It encourages foresight, organization, and problem-solving. This strand assesses the student's organizational skills and their ability to break down a larger goal into manageable tasks. It also ensures that the student has thought through the practicalities of their project, increasing the likelihood of successful completion and effective use of time and resources.</p>

            <h3>Criterion B, Strand i: Explain how the ATL skill(s) was/were applied to help achieve their learning goal.</h3>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This strand focuses on the student's metacognitive awareness – their ability to identify and articulate how specific Approaches to Learning (ATL) skills were consciously utilized to support their learning journey and progress towards their learning goal. This requires more than just listing skills; it demands an explanation of *how* these skills were put into practice with examples or evidence.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification:</strong> The ATL skills are central to the MYP, equipping students with the tools for lifelong learning. This strand encourages students to reflect on and explicitly demonstrate their development of these critical skills. By connecting ATL skills to their learning goal, students recognize the practical application and value of these skills in real-world contexts, fostering a deeper understanding of their own learning processes.</p>

            <h3>Criterion B, Strand ii: Explain how the ATL skill(s) was/were applied to help achieve their product.</h3>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Similar to Strand i, this strand requires the student to explain how specific ATL skills were directly and intentionally used to facilitate the creation and development of their product. This means providing concrete examples or evidence of how skills like research, self-management, communication, or thinking skills were instrumental in bringing the product to fruition.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This strand reinforces the practical application of ATL skills. It demonstrates that the skills are not just theoretical but are essential for effective project execution. By linking ATL skills to product creation, students develop a holistic understanding of how these skills contribute to tangible outcomes, enhancing their problem-solving abilities and efficiency in practical tasks.</p>

            <h3>Criterion C, Strand i: Explain the impact of the project on themselves or their learning.</h3>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This strand asks students to reflect deeply on the personal growth and learning they experienced as a result of undertaking the project. This can encompass changes in their understanding, development of new skills, shifts in perspective, or enhanced self-awareness. The explanation should be insightful and specific, moving beyond superficial statements.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification:</strong> Reflection is a cornerstone of the MYP, fostering self-regulated learning. This strand encourages students to internalize their experiences and identify how the project has contributed to their intellectual and personal development. Understanding the impact helps students recognize the value of their efforts and provides valuable insights for future learning endeavors.</p>

            <h3>Criterion C, Strand ii: Evaluate the product based on the success criteria.</h3>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In this strand, students must critically assess their final product against the specific success criteria they established in Criterion A, Strand ii. This evaluation should be supported by concrete evidence and detailed examples from the project's development and outcome. It involves judging both the strengths and weaknesses of the product in relation to the predefined standards.</p>
            <p><strong>Justification:</strong> Evaluating the product against pre-defined success criteria promotes objectivity and critical thinking. It allows students to make an informed judgment about the quality and effectiveness of their work, identifying areas of achievement and areas for improvement. This process reinforces the importance of setting clear goals and provides a framework for self-assessment, a crucial skill for future academic and personal projects.</p>
